2. Run the command: java -jar ./environmentLoggerServer.jar 6602

Alternatively
1. Double click on Start Server.bat in the file explorer to open the server

## Usage
The server will run on port 6602 by default, this can be changed by altering the last argument in the command line to run it.

## Compatability and Versioning
Exported in JDK version 21.0.2+13-LTS-58:
 
Tested and verified as working on a system running java runtime environment build 21.0.2+13-LTS-58:
 
For compatibility reasons jars from version 18.0.1.1+2-6 have been included in separate files, should the recent versions not work the older version jars should be moved into the main folder and previous steps followed.
